# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user

### Step 2:
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable

### Step 3:
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.

Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 4:
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable

### Step 5:
Print both the values it would be interchanged

### Step 6:
End the program
